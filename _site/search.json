    "text": "Background\nFollowing the Decisions of the EUROCONTROL Permanent Commission in 1997 an independent performance review system addressing all aspects of air traffic management was established as of 1998, and the Performance Review Commission (PRC) was created to provide independent advice on Air Navigation Services (ANS) performance in the EUROCONTROL Member States.\nHence, the first pan-European performance review system was created by EUROCONTROL for its Member States in 1998 as a light touch system consisting of independent performance monitoring and target setting at pan-European level. It helps States, ANSPs, airports and other interested parties to see their performance from a European perspective and to identify good practices and areas that need improvement."

    "text": "Tasks\nThe purpose of the independent Performance Review Commission (PRC) is “to ensure the effective management of the European Air Navigation Services (ANS) system through a strong, transparent and independent performance review system”, per Article 1 of its Terms of Reference.\nEUROCONTROL and the European Union have a long-standing relationship and history of cooperation in ATM and in the implementation of the Single European Sky (SES) and other related policies. Of central importance is the contribution that the EUROCONTROL Performance Review System and the Performance Scheme of the Single European Sky (SES) jointly make towards improving the overall performance of air navigation services and network functions. The PRU provides support to the European Commission (EC) under a service contract, signed in 2017, which runs for four years. Activities include, inter alia, support to monitoring, target setting and assessment of performance plans. The PRU also supports the EC, its Agencies and Advisory Bodies under a longer-term co-operation agreement. The PRC’s work avoids potential overlaps with that of the Performance Review Body (PRB) which assists the European Commission (EC) in the implementation of the SES Performance Scheme. The PRC/PRU tasks can be categorised as follows:\n\nData collection and analysis: Collection and analysis of performance-related data and make independent recommendations to the EUROCONTROL States;\nReporting: Provision of impartial, independent and unbiased information to facilitate stakeholder dialogue. The PRC publishes an annual PRR and an annual ATM Cost-Effectiveness (ACE) Benchmarking report. In 2019, the PRC placed more focus on researching specific topics, in consultation with stakeholders, and in publishing the results as PRC Technical Notes. The PRC is constantly reviewing its work programme to ensure that it remains relevant and useful to stakeholders. It publishes “Performance Insight” short papers on topical themes The Aviation Intelligence Portal (www.ansperformance.eu) provides a variety of interactive dashboards for more detailed analysis and offers monthly updates of performance information covering all EUROCONTROL Member States.\nResearch and development: Conducting of research to further improve the performance measurement framework and to test new indicators;\nInternational benchmarking: Provision of assistance to ICAO and other regions of the world in benchmarking different systems and promoting/developing harmonised standards for data collection and sharing, including the establishment of an open data platform for performance benchmarking. The PRU ensures a strong input to the global developments of the performance based approach benefitting from the European experience."

    "section": "Methodology",
    "text": "Methodology\nThe main assumption for the analysis of vertical flight efficiency during climb and descent is that, all other factors being equal, level flight is considered as inefficient. The methodology presented here is very similar for the climb and descent phases so the results for the climb and descent phases are directly comparable.\n\nGeneral overview\nThe analysis is performed in 5 major steps. First, the trajectory data has to be loaded into the analysis software. Then the climb or descent part is identified in these trajectories. In these parts of the trajectories the level segments are detected and saved and additional filters are applied. The next step is the determination of the Top of Climb or Top of Descent. Finally, the results are calculated and processed for presentation. This process is visualised in Figure 1.\n(ref:vfe-cd-figure-001) Different steps of the analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n(ref:vfe-cd-figure-001)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoading of the trajectories information\nThe data used for the analysis are downloaded from the PRISME database. CPF data is used in order to assess the actually flown trajectories.\nThe most important data fields that are of interest for the analysis are the altitude, position (latitude and longitude) and time information.\n\n\nIdentification of the climb or descent part of the flight\nFor each flight, the climb part is defined as the part of the trajectory before the Top of Climb (ToC) and the descent part as the part of the trajectory after the Top of Descent (ToD).\nOptimal climb and descent parts until/from the cruising altitude generally require less than 200NM of track distance from/until the airport, especially when the cost index is low or high for respectively the climb and descent (Airbus 1998; Sam Peeters 2013). With this in mind, the analysis is limited to the parts of the trajectories within a 200NM radius around the departure/arrival airport. This is to avoid including into the analysis climbs during the cruise phase which are used to optimise the flight altitude to account for the reducing weight of the aircraft.\nThe identification method of the climb or descent part corresponds strongly to the method proposed by the CCO/CDO Task Force and is further detailed below. It should be noted that the CCO/CDO Task Force uses a 300NM radius for the climbs instead of 200NM as used in this analysis. The reasons for choosing a 200NM radius for the climb are threefold:\n\nHaving the same radius for both the climb and descent analysis enables a direct comparison between the climb and descent results; and\nExamination of aircraft trajectories showed that when a radius of 300NM is used, a lot of level flight at slightly lower altitudes than the cruising altitude is detected as inefficient, while this could be a consequence of the optimisation of the cruising altitude with respect to the aircraft’s weight. This type of level flight should not be seen as being inefficient and can influence the final results significantly in such a way that the results are not representative; and\n300NM was chosen by the CCO/CDO Task Force because some very heavy aircraft could not be able to reach the cruising altitude within a 200NM radius. Nevertheless, it is preferred to have a stable methodology that suits best the behaviour of most of the flights and provides statistically correct results and analyses.\n\n\n\nIdentification of the climb part of a flight\nFor each flight, the 4D point where the flight crosses the 200NM radius around the departure airport (for the first time) is determined. This point is defined as D200. Within the part of the trajectory from take-off until D200 included, the first 4D point at which the aircraft reaches the highest altitude is defined as the ToC-D200. If the aircraft is still climbing when passing the 200NM radius, D200 and ToC-D200 are the same.\nThe climb phase is considered to start at 3000 feet AGL since the Noise Abatement Departure Procedures (NADP) defined by ICAO end at this altitude (ICAO 2006).\nOverall, the part of the trajectory considered for the analysis goes from 3000 feet AGL (included) until ToC-D200.\nThe CCO/CDO Task Force uses 2500 feet as lower limit which is chosen in relation to the availability of trajectory data.\n\n\nIdentification of the descent part of a flight\nFor each flight, the 4D point where the flight crosses the 200NM radius around the destination airport (for the last time) is determined. This point is defined as A200. Within the part of the trajectory from A200 included until touchdown, the last 4D point at which the aircraft leaves the highest altitude is defined as the ToD-A200.\nThe descent phase is considered to end at 1800 feet AGL because the interception altitude for ILS systems is generally at or above this altitude. Using 1800 feet AGL as lower limit allows capturing the level segments before ILS interception but on the other hand disregarding the trajectory below 1800 feet AGL where the aircraft are on the ILS glideslope and no level segments should occur.\nOverall, the part of the trajectory considered for the analysis goes from ToD-A200 until 1800 feet AGL (included)."

After consultation in the CCO/CDO Task Force, this vertical velocity is chosen to be 300 feet per minute. Consequently, the dimensions of the window have to adhere to the following relationship:\n\\[\n\\frac{Y}{X} = 300 \\  \\textrm{feet per minute}\n\\]\nE.g. when a temporal size of 10 seconds is used, the window is 50 feet high. In this case the altitude information of the climb or descent trajectory is considered at every interval of 10 seconds. However, since the CPF data are a discrete representation of the actual trajectories, the necessary altitude information is not available for every required time instance. Because of this and whenever required, a linear interpolation is done to obtain the information needed for the analysis."

The exclusion box ranges from the altitude of ToC-D200 or ToD-A200 down to 90% of this altitude. When a level segment is detected inside the exclusion box and it lasts longer than 5 minutes, it is not considered in the final results. The new top of climb or top of descent is in that case put at the start of (the first of) such segment(s) for climbs or at the end of (the last of) such segment(s) for descents. This new ToC or ToD is called respectively ToC-CCO or ToD-CDO. When no level segments longer than 5 minutes are detected inside the exclusion box, ToC-CCO/ToD-CDO coincides with ToC-D200/ToD-A200.\nThe determination of the ToC-CCO or ToD-CDO corresponds as well to the CCO/CDO Task Force’s approach."

    "section": "Processing of the results",
    "text": "Processing of the results\nThe final results are calculated taking into account all level segments before ToC-CCO for the climbs and after ToD-CDO for the descents.\nThe results of the analysis include the total number of flights, the average value and median value of the distance flown level, the percentage of distance flown level with respect to the total climb or descent distance, the average value and median value of the time flown level, the percentage of time flown level with respect to the total climb or descent time and the average value and median value of the number of level segments.\nAn additional metric is the median CDO/CCO altitude. This metric is calculated by taking the altitude of the lowest level segment for each flight. This information is then aggregated by taking the median value over all considered flights. The rationale for using the lowest level segment is the following. It is best to have no level flight because this increases the fuel burn. However, if needed, the higher the level segment occurs, the better because the higher the level segment occurs, the lower the fuel burn. E.g. a level segment of a fixed duration at FL100 burns more fuel than at FL300. So, the lowest level segment is considered since it has the highest environmental impact.\nIn addition, each flight can be assessed as being CCO (Continuous Climb Operations) or CDO (Continuous Descent Operations). The fact whether a flight is considered as being CCO or CDO depends on the allowed amount of level segments and their allowed lengths or durations.\nThe formulas used for the calculation of all these results are shown in Table @ref(tab:formulas).\n\n(#tab:formulas) Formulas used for the calculation of the results\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResult\nFormula\n\n\n\n\nTotal distance flown by flight \\(f\\) during the climb/descent\n(ref:total-flown-cd)\n\n\nPercentage of distance flown level during the climb/descent\n(ref:perc-flown-level-cd)\n\n\nAverage value of the distance flown level per flight\n(ref:avg-flown-flight-level)\n\n\nMedian value of the level distance\n(ref:median-level-dist)\n\n\nTotal time flown by flight \\(f\\) during the climb/descent\n(ref:total-flown-flight-cd)\n\n\nPercentage of time flown level during the climb/descent\n(ref:perc-flown-flight-level)\n\n\nAverage time flown level per flight\n(ref:avg-time-flight-level)\n\n\nMedian value of the level time\n(ref:median-time)\n\n\nAverage number of level segments per flight\n(ref:avg-level-segs)\n\n\nMedian value of the number of level segments\n(ref:median-level-segs)\n\n\nPercentage of flights considered as CCO or CDO\n\\[P = \\frac{n_0}{n} \\cdot 100\\]\n\n\n\n(ref:total-flown-cd) \\[D_f^+ = \\begin{cases} D_{3000, f} - D_{\\textrm{TOC} - \\textrm{CCO}, f}, & \\text{climbs} \\\\ D_{\\textrm{TOD} - \\textrm{CDO}, f} - D_{1800, f}, & \\text{descents} \\end{cases}\\]\n(ref:perc-flown-level-cd) \\[D_{\\textrm{perc}} = \\frac{ \\sum_{f} D_f}{\\sum_{f} D_f^+} \\cdot 100\\]\n(ref:avg-flown-flight-level) \\[D_{\\textrm{avg}} = \\frac{ \\sum_{f} D_f}{n}\\]\n(ref:median-level-dist) \\[D_{med} = \\begin{cases} D_m & \\text{$n$ is odd, $m = (n+1)/2$} \\\\ \\frac{D_m + D_{m+1}}{2}, & \\text{$n$ is even, $m = n/2$} \\end{cases}\\]\n(ref:total-flown-flight-cd) \\[T_f^+ = \\begin{cases} T_{3000, f} - T_{\\textrm{TOC} - \\textrm{CCO}, f}, & \\text{climbs} \\\\ T_{\\textrm{TOD} - \\textrm{CDO}, f} - T_{1800, f}, & \\text{descents} \\end{cases}\\]\n(ref:perc-flown-flight-level) \\[T_{\\textrm{perc}} = \\frac{\\sum_f T_f}{\\sum_f T_f^+}\\]\n(ref:avg-time-flight-level) \\[T_{\\textrm{avg}} = \\frac{\\sum_f T_f}{n}\\]\n(ref:median-time) \\[T_{med} = \\begin{cases} T_m & \\text{$n$ is odd, $m = (n+1)/2$} \\\\ \\frac{T_m + T_{m+1}}{2}, & \\text{$n$ is even, $m = n/2$} \\end{cases}\\]\n(ref:avg-level-segs) \\[_{\\textrm{avg}} = \\frac{\\sum_f L_f}{n}\\]\n(ref:median-level-segs) \\[L_{med} = \\begin{cases} \\displaystyle L_m & \\text{$n$ is odd, $m = (n+1)/2$} \\\\ \\frac{L_m + L_{m+1}}{2}, & \\text{$n$ is even, $m = n/2$} \\end{cases}\\]\nWith:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSymbol\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\\(n\\)\nTotal number of flights considered in the analysis\n\n\n\\(n_0\\)\nNumber of flights considered as CCO or CDO\n\n\n\\(L_f\\)\nNumber of level segments for flight \\(f\\)\n\n\n\\(D_f^{+}\\)\nTotal distance flown by flight \\(f\\) during the climb/descent\n\n\n\\(D_f\\)\nTotal distance flown level by flight \\(f\\) during the climb/descent\n\n\n\\(D_{3000, f}\\)\nTrack distance flown by flight \\(f\\) when passing \\(3000\\) feet AGL\n\n\n\\(D_{\\textrm{TOC} - \\textrm{CCO}, f}\\)\nTrack distance flown by flight \\(f\\) when passing TOC-CCO\n\n\n\\(D_{\\textrm{TOD} - \\textrm{CDO}, f}\\)\nTrack distance flown by flight \\(f\\) when passing TOD-CDO\n\n\n\\(D_{1800, f}\\)\nTrack distance flown by flight \\(f\\) when passing 1800 feet AGL\n\n\n\\(T_f^{+}\\)\nTotal time flown by flight \\(f\\) during the climb/descent\n\n\n\\(T_f\\)\nTotal time flown level by flight \\(f\\) during the climb/descent\n\n\n\\(T_{3000, f}\\)\nTime at which flight \\(f\\) passes \\(3000\\) feet AGL\n\n\n\\(T_{\\textrm{TOC} - \\textrm{CCO}, f}\\)\nTime at which flight \\(f\\) passes TOC-CCO\n\n\n\\(T_{\\textrm{TOD} - \\textrm{CDO}, f}\\)\nTime at which flight \\(f\\) passes TOD-CDO\n\n\n\\(T_{1800, f}\\)\nTime at which flight \\(f\\) passes \\(1800\\) feet AGL"

Although safety procedures and policies have become well established, implemented and enforced, there is always a risk, however remote, of complacency creeping in. To ensure that this never happens, a CRI methodology can assist the key parties concerned to ensure that all aspects of safety management systems, for example policy, safety oversight, safety data reporting, pro-active actions to prevent safety threats, etc., are given top priority at all times.\nA standard safety report with typical incident or accident trends may highlight some aspects. However, such safety reports do not always give an insight and overall impression of how safety is performing over time or enable comparisons with different States or stakeholders. It is from this perspective that the PRC has developed a CRI Methodology. It is not designed to replace reporting on specific aspects of safety. Its purpose is to assist key decision makers, policymakers, and operations staff as well as Safety specialists by providing an easy overview to monitor and possibly compare the safety risks, either for one provider or for a State to make an overview of annual developments. Ultimately, based on data availability, it can be used as a kind of benchmark between ANSPs, States or regions at one moment in time or over several years."

    "text": "Problem: How can the total safety risk be measured?\nRisk is the potential for mishaps or other adverse variation in the cost, schedule, or safety performance of the ATM system. Safety risk therefore can be explained as the potential for mishaps that could result in injury, fatality, equipment or system damage or total loss.\nConceptually, all safety programmes desire accurate safety risk quantification in order to provide a meaningful expression of risk. As there are typically multiple safety risks associated with a system or event, the quantification of total safety risk is a major challenge.\nOne possible way to define the total safety risk of any system is using the concept of a composite risk estimate [@burns2016]. Current methods of obtaining this composite risk estimate use summing techniques to add the individual risks and produce a single number [@burns2016],[@nardo2005]. This method seems natural, however, it is often difficult to determine particular occurrence probabilities (e.g. when historical information is of limited time series) or to quantify their severity (e.g. when information in safety databases is missing). That makes the additive computation of risk difficult or impossible.\nMoreover, although risk in general can be quantified, as it represents a combination of probability and severity of specific occurrence happening, the human perception of risk often influences how risk is addressed [@slovic2016]. For example, on the level of decision makers the risk perception does not necessarily map directly to probability and severity in a linear fashion. That makes computation of total risk additionally difficult and subjective."

    "text": "What is the PRC’s proposal to measure total safety risk?\nIn PRR 2018, the PRC presented the preliminary concept of the CRI and a corresponding methodology that could be used to measure the performance of the European ATM system as a whole or also its individual entities (service providers or Member States).\nThis initial calculation of the CRI was mainly based on reported safety occurrences. More specifically, the CRI was represented as a cumulative risk value calculated aggregating all reported, assessed and severity classified key safety‐related incidents to form an index.\nThe measure of risk exposure was based on probability and severity that considers the human perception of equivalent risk. The overall idea behind the CRI was that the performance of the safety system can be analysed in three important broad categories: (1) the quality of the reporting system with reporting entity, (2) measured risks within the system, and (3) the human perception of risk.\nClick here for an explanation of this preliminary CRI methodology including a working example\nAt the same time, the PRC also has highlighted that there could be possibilities to further improve the CRI by considering specific local operating conditions, airspace size, capacity and/or complexity. In order to improve the initial CRI methodology, further consideration of local operating conditions, airspace size and complexity of the airspace were taken into consideration. As a result, three additional components, besides the original one (Safety Data), were considered in the new methodology. The new CRI methodology includes hence four distinct components, or Intermediate Composite Indexes (ICIs):\n\nSafety data (with the following parameters: number and type of safety occurrences, severity classification, and human perception of risk),\nTraffic / exposure data (consisting of the following parameters: flight hours and airport movements),\nComplexity (namely adjusted density, structural index and Complexity index), and\nReporting practices (described through parameters of reporting rate and reporting culture).\n\nFigure @ref(fig:crimethod) shows all components of the proposed CRI index.\n\n\n\n\n\nCRI Methodology Components"

In other words, the optimisation will find which combination of weights result in the lowest standard deviation of CRI values between the years for each Entity.\nDue to a large number of variables involved and the enormous number of combinations possible, the optimisation and selection of the Weights combination is done in stages:\n\nSelection of Weights for accident, all OPS occurrences and TECH occurrences\nSelection of Weights for OPS occurrences based on their type (RI, SMI, UPA, OTHER), taking into consideration overall OPS Weight determined in Step 1\nSelection of Weights for OPS and TECH occurrences based on their severity (AA/A, B, C), taking into consideration overall OPS Weight determined in Step 2\n\nIn addition, each type of weight selection has predefined weight ranges, to allow for an incremental Severity classification order, based on human perception of risk (from accident to Severity C incident, i.e. from high risk to low risk). In other words, each range has an expectation value associated with it. See further details in the methodology report (Commission 2019)\n\n\nCRI normalisation\nTo allow the applicability of the CRI to airspaces with different traffic levels, the CRI is normalised by flight hours for each Entity.

    "section": "Methodology",
    "text": "Methodology\n\nApproach and assumptions\nThe general approach of the analysis is to compare the maximum altitudes in the flight plans of flights between a specific airport pair with the maximum altitudes of flights between similar airport pairs, hereafter called reference flights. Reference flights are flights between unconstrained (in terms of RAD restrictions) airport pairs which have a great circle distance close to the one of the examined airport pair.\nSince the aircraft type has a significant influence on the nominal cruising altitude, the analysis is done using specific aircraft types with similar performance (e.g. only jet aircraft, turboprop aircraft …) Currently only Airbus and Boeing aircraft are considered since they account for the biggest portion of scheduled commercial flights.\nThe use of the maximum altitude in the flight plan leads to an underestimation of the vertical flight inefficiency because there can be lower cruise segments before or after the moment the maximum altitude is reached. These cruise segments can be even more inefficient since the fuel consumption at lower altitudes is in general higher.\nTo account for statistical uncertainty, the lowest and highest 10 percent of the flights (when sorted according to their maximum altitudes) are excluded.\n\n\nGeneral overview\nThe analysis is done in 4 major steps. First, the necessary data are extracted from the data source. Then the reference distributions are calculated such that they can be used for all the airport pairs under investigation. For each considered airport pair, the maximum altitudes in the flight plan are processed in order to be compared with the reference. In the last step the different metrics are calculated. The process is visualised in Figure @ref(fig:vfe-er-figure-001).\n(ref:vfe-er-figure-001) Different steps of the analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n(ref:vfe-er-figure-001)\n\n\n\n\nThe following paragraphs explain these steps in further detail.\n\n\nLoading of the trajectories information\nThe data used for the analysis are downloaded from the PRISME database. FTFM data is used in order to assess the maximum altitudes in the flight plans. The most important data fields for the analysis are the altitude and time information.\n\n\nDefinition of the reference distribution\nReference airport pairs are airport pairs with a great circle distance (GCD) close to the great circle distance of the considered airport pair and which have no constraints in the RAD.\nReference distributions are calculated for buckets of GCD ranges, e.g. a reference is calculated for all airport pairs in the GCD ranges [0,10) NM, [10,20) NM, etc. This approach reduces the calculation time significantly since only one calculation is needed and the reference for a specific airport pair will be the one of the corresponding bucket.\nThe reference distribution is created using a large number of flights with no specific filtering except for the aircraft type. This is done in order to get a reference distribution irrespective of factors such as aircraft weights, weather phenomena, company policies…\nThe reference is based on the assumption that flights between airport pairs with similar GCDs, performed with a similar aircraft type, would file for similar maximum altitudes. The differentiating factor between the two sets of flights can be the presence of RAD constraints, scenarios, airline policy, mistakes in the flight planning system, etc., and if the distribution of the maximum altitudes of flights on the chosen airport pair doesn’t follow the reference distribution, this could be an indication of inefficiency.\n\n\nDistribution of the maximum altitudes\nAs is done for the reference, the distribution of the maximum altitudes flown on the considered airport pair is determined. Having the distributions of the reference and the considered flow on the airport pair allows for plotting a diagram as in the Figure @ref(fig:vfe-er-figure-002).\nFigure @ref(fig:vfe-er-figure-002) shows the histograms of the maximum filed altitudes both for the reference flights and the flights on the chosen airport pair. The numbers on the right of the bars indicate the number of flights while the length of the bar indicates the percentage of flights. E.g. the large blue bar at FL350 represents 260 flights, being 76.2% of the total number of flights on the chosen airport pair. The sum of the percentages corresponding to the lengths of the bars is 100% both for the blue and for the red bars. As can be seen from the values of the number of flights, there are a lot more flights in the reference distribution which makes it a stable reference.\n(ref:vfe-er-figure-002) Example distribution of maximum altitudes.\n\n\n\n\n\n(ref:vfe-er-figure-002)\n\n\n\n\nThe data in Figure @ref(fig:vfe-er-figure-002) above can be represented differently, using percentiles as shown in Figure @ref(fig:vfe-er-figure-003). To obtain this, the percentages from Figure @ref(fig:vfe-er-figure-002) are simply put successively. E.g. the percentages of the chosen airport pair (blue bars: 2.6% at FL310, 21.1% at FL330 and 76.2% at FL350) are plotted at their respective altitudes to get the blue line in Figure @ref(fig:vfe-er-figure-003). The same is done for the reference.\nThe example represents an airport pair on which, in general, flights are filing higher than the reference. There are however some percentiles where reference flights are filing higher than the flights on the considered airport pair. Only this part is used in the calculation of vertical flight inefficiency (VFI) in order to flag only the inefficiencies. The red shaded area in Figure @ref(fig:vfe-er-figure-003) indicates the VFI. The dark grey areas on the left and right highlight the percentiles that are excluded to account for statistical uncertainty as mentioned before.\n(ref:vfe-er-figure-003) Example distribution of maximum altitudes.\n\n\n\n\n\n(ref:vfe-er-figure-003)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculation of the metrics\nThe VFI is calculated using the percentiles as shown in Figure @ref(fig:vfe-er-figure-003). For each percentile range, the altitude value of the airport pair is subtracted from the reference value. When the airport pair value is higher than the reference value, the result of the subtraction is negative. This might appear as if the flights are more efficient than the reference flights. Nevertheless, the focus is put on finding the inefficiencies so negative values are set to 0.\nThe result of the percentile range is then multiplied by the number of flights corresponding to the percentile range (e.g. if the width of the percentile range is 1%, the number of flights corresponding to the percentile range is 1% of the total number of flights on the airport pair).\nSumming up over all percentile ranges gives the total vertical flight inefficiency. The vertical flight inefficiency per flight value is then calculated by dividing the total vertical flight inefficiency by the number of flights on the considered airport pair (the number of flights for this calculation step is 80% of the total number of flights on the airport pair since the lowest 10% and highest 10% of the flights are not used).\nTable @ref(tab:formulas) summarises the formulas used for the calculation of the VFI metrics.\n\n(#tab:formulas) Formulas used for the calculation of the results\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResult\nFormula\n\n\n\n\nTotal vertical flight inefficiency (Total VFI)\n(ref:total-vfi)\n\n\nVertical flight inefficiency per flight (VFI per flight)\n(ref:vfi-flight)\n\n\n\n(ref:total-vfi) \\[VFI_{\\mathrm{tot}} = \\sum_{i} \\max(L_{\\mathrm{ref}, i} - L_{\\mathrm{act}, i}, 0) \\cdot n_{\\mathrm{act}, i}\\]\n(ref:vfi-flight) \\[\\frac{VFI_{\\mathrm{tot}} }{\\sum_{i} n_{\\textrm{act}, i}}\\]\nWith:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSymbol\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\\(i\\)\nPercentile range\n\n\n\\(L_{ {ref}, i}\\)\nFlight level of the \\(i^{th}\\) percentile range over all reference flights in the GCD bucket around the GCD of the considered airport pair.\n\n\n\\(L_{ {act}, i}\\)\nFlight level of the \\(i^{th}\\) percentile range over all flights on the considered airport pair.\n\n\n\\(n_{ {act}, i}\\)\nNumber of flights on the considered airport pair in the percentile range."

The sum of the great circle distances in the different areas traversed is always larger than the great circle distance between origin and destination.

In the example above, while the two trajectories are identical within the FAB, their contribution would be different because the inefficiency of trajectory \\(1\\) outside the FAB will be taken into account (as a matter of fact, the calculation would not isolate the local performance).

    "text": "Aggregation of results to produce the indicator\nOnce the origin and destination of a flight have been set, via the use of achieved distances it is possible to compute in a consistent way the value of the indicator between any two points of the trajectory of a flight. It is important to note that the flight efficiency is an average measurement where the average is taken over distances and not over flights. This is particularly useful when dealing with three specific aspects:\n\nThe measurement of the en-route flight inefficiency. The indicator is concerned with the enroute flight inefficiency defined as the measurement which excludes 40 nautical miles around airports. The measurement does not start until the trajectory has crossed (for the first time) the cylinder with a 40 nautical miles radius around the airport of departure and ends when the trajectory crosses (for the last time) the cylinder with a 40 nautical miles radius around the airport of arrival.\nThe measurement of local inefficiencies. The indicator based on achieved distances is well defined even when the direct route between origin and destination does not cross the local area. It is also well defined when a trajectory exits and re-enters a local area (the two measurements are independent).\nThe measurement of inefficiency when the trajectory is not complete (which might be the case for CPF trajectories). The measurement is well defined for every portion of the trajectory, and does not require a complete trajectory.\n\nWhen looking at a specific flight, it is always possible to decompose the flight in different portions, of which some will not be taken into consideration for the calculation of the indicator (as an example, the first part of the trajectory will never be included because it will either be inside the 40 nautical miles or outside of the reference area). Every portion can be attributed to a specific measured area (e.g., a State, a FAB, the SES area).\nFlight efficiency compares the length of a trajectory with the great circle distance. The indicator is expressed as a ratio of the length of trajectories and achieved distances:\n\\[\n\\text{HFE}_j = \\frac{\\sum L_{fjp} - \\sum H_{fjp}}{\\sum H{fjp}} \\% = \\left( \\frac{\\sum L_{fjp}}{\\sum H_{fjp}} - 1 \\right) \\%\n\\]\nIn words, the en route horizontal flight efficiency indicator for an area j is taken by summing the values over all flights f and all en route portions p in the area (a flight might re-enter the area).\nAt a technical level, it is worth noting again that the indicator is an average per distance unit and not per flight."

A measured area is an area for which HFE values are reported. Any measured area (e.g., State, FAB, SES area) must be contained in the reference area.\nWhat is the definition of origin and destination?\nThe origin and destination correspond to the first and last point of the trajectory within the reference area, where the trajectory considered is the entire trajectory from airport to airport. Any portion of the trajectory before the origin and after the destination is ignored when calculating the flight efficiency. There is one origin and one destination for each trajectory. Origin and destination are defined at trajectory level – O and D in the notation used in previous section are the same for all entries and exits of a trajectory.\nWhat happens when the trajectory crosses the 40 nautical miles cylinder several times?\nOnly one point is taken into consideration for each airport. For the departure airport it corresponds to the first crossing, while for the arrival airport it corresponds to the last crossing. The en route part of the flight is the one between those two points. Any portion before or after the en route part is ignored when calculating the en route flight efficiency. The start and the end en route phase are defined at trajectory level.\nWhat happens when the circle around the airport is not fully inside/outside the reference area? What happens when the en route portion begins/ends inside a measured area? What happens when part of the trajectory is not available?\nAll the above questions relate to the definition of the portions of trajectory used for the calculation of the en route indicator for a measured area. Four separate and independent aspects have to be considered:\n\nA portion has to be within the origin and the destination (for flight efficiency to be defined);\nA portion has to be en route (i.e., the cylinders around airports have to excluded);\nA portion has to be within the measured area;\nThe information has to be available.\n\nThe four conditions have to be valid at the same time. This means that in some cases the end points of the portion considered for flight efficiency in a measured area (the entry N and the exit X in the notation used in previous sections) will not correspond to the borders of the measured area.\nThe main reason for the entry/exit points not being on the border of the measured area is the exclusion of the circles around the airport (see table above and the following examples). A secondary reason is the absence of information for a part of a trajectory (see example below).\nConsider the case of a flight departing from a measured area A, with the circle/cylinder entirely contained in the measurement area A. The origin (\\(O_f\\)) will be the airport because it will be the first point into the reference area (a measured area is always part of the reference area). As the part within the cylinder has to be excluded when measuring the en route flight efficiency, the entry into the measured area (\\(N_A\\)) will correspond to the first crossing of the (departure airport) cylinder. It is neither the airport (airports can never be the entry or exit point for en route flight efficiency because of the exclusion of the circle around them) nor the border of the measured area A. The situation corresponds to the standard “departing” or “internal” row in the table above.\nConsider the same case above, except that the circle extends into another measured area B and the first crossing is happening there. The origin will still be located at the airport in measured area A, but there will be no portion of trajectory considered for measured area A because the en route part will not have started. The entry into measured area B (NB) will again correspond to the first crossing of the (departure airport) cylinder and not the airport or the border of measured area B.\nAs a third alternative, consider the case where the circle around area A extends outside the reference area, the first crossing happens there and the flight then re-enter measured area A. The origin will again be located at the airport; the en route portion will start outside the reference area; the first entry into area A (NA) will be the one from outside the reference area.\nLast, consider the case where a flight traverses a measured area, with entry and exit on the borders but with a part of the trajectory for which the information is missing. In that case there will be two portions of the trajectory considered: the first one from the border (\\(N_1\\)) until the information is lost (\\(X_1\\)) and a second one from when the information is again available (\\(N_2\\)) until the exit from the measured area (\\(X_2\\)).\nWhat happens when the trajectory enters an area several times? Every couple of entry and exit points (see the previous answer for why the entry and exit points might not correspond to points on the border of the measured area considered) defines a portion of the flight for which the length of the trajectory and the achieved distance can be calculated. All portions within a measured area are considered in the calculation of the indicator for that area.\nIt is important to note that multiple entries are considered separately and it is not the first point of entry and the last point of exit of a measured area which are considered (see last example in the previous question).\nCan the achieved distance be negative? The achieved distance relies on the order of the points considered; it is therefore possible (although uncommon) for the local achieved distance to be negative. This ensures that the calculation of the local additional distances is consistent (any partition of the trajectory gives the same result).\nWhat is the impact of short flights (for which the great circle distance is small)? The horizontal flight efficiency (HFE) is not an average per flight, but a weighted average which takes into consideration the great circle distance (\\(K\\) is the additional distance, \\(G\\) is the great circle distance, \\(H\\) is the achieved distance; \\(f\\) indicates a flight, \\(j\\) indicates an area, \\(p\\) indicates a portion of the flight):\n\\[\n\\text{HFE} = \\sum w_f \\cdot \\frac{K_f}{G_f} = \\sum \\frac{G_f}{\\sum G_f} \\cdot \\frac{K_f}{G_f}\n= \\frac{\\sum K_f}{\\sum G_f} = \\frac{K_f}{H_f} \\cong \\frac{\\sum K_{fjp}}{\\sum\nH_{fjp}}\n\\]\nThe contribution to the additional distance of each portion of the flight is proportional to the achieved distance of the same portion. The impact of short flights is therefore proportional to their lengths.\nWhat is the impact of unusual circumstances on the annual indicator?\nWhen calculating the annual indicator the values for the ten best days and the ten worst days are excluded from the computation."

    "text": "Why a Composite Risk Index?\nSafety in aviation is paramount. Although safety procedures and policies have become well established, implemented and enforced, there is always a risk, however remote, of complacency creeping in. To ensure that this never happens, a CRI methodology can assist the key parties concerned to ensure that all aspects of safety management systems, for example policy, safety oversight, safety data reporting, pro-active actions to prevent safety threats, etc., are given top priority at all times.\nA standard safety report with typical incident or accident trends may highlight some aspects. However, such safety reports do not always give an insight and overall impression of how safety is performing over time or enable comparisons with different States or stakeholders. It is from this perspective that the PRC has developed a CRI Methodology. It is not designed to replace reporting on specific aspects of safety. Its purpose is to assist key decision makers, policymakers, and operations staff as well as Safety specialists by providing an easy overview to monitor and possibly compare the safety risks, either for one provider or for a State to make an overview of annual developments. Ultimately, based on data availability, it can be used as a kind of benchmark between ANSPs, States or regions at one moment in time or over several years."

    "section": "Problem: How can the total safety risk be measured?",
    "text": "Problem: How can the total safety risk be measured?\nRisk is the potential for mishaps or other adverse variation in the cost, schedule, or safety performance of the ATM system. Safety risk therefore can be explained as the potential for mishaps that could result in injury, fatality, equipment or system damage or total loss.\nConceptually, all safety programmes desire accurate safety risk quantification in order to provide a meaningful expression of risk. As there are typically multiple safety risks associated with a system or event, the quantification of total safety risk is a major challenge.\nOne possible way to define the total safety risk of any system is using the concept of a composite risk estimate (Burns 2016). Current methods of obtaining this composite risk estimate use summing techniques to add the individual risks and produce a single number (Burns 2016),(Nardo 2005). This method seems natural, however, it is often difficult to determine particular occurrence probabilities (e.g. when historical information is of limited time series) or to quantify their severity (e.g. when information in safety databases is missing). That makes the additive computation of risk difficult or impossible.\nMoreover, although risk in general can be quantified, as it represents a combination of probability and severity of specific occurrence happening, the human perception of risk often influences how risk is addressed (Slovic 2016). For example, on the level of decision makers the risk perception does not necessarily map directly to probability and severity in a linear fashion. That makes computation of total risk additionally difficult and subjective."

    "text": "What is the PRC’s proposal to measure total safety risk?\nIn PRR 2018, the PRC presented the preliminary concept of the CRI and a corresponding methodology that could be used to measure the performance of the European ATM system as a whole or also its individual entities (service providers or Member States).\nThis initial calculation of the CRI was mainly based on reported safety occurrences. More specifically, the CRI was represented as a cumulative risk value calculated aggregating all reported, assessed and severity classified key safety‐related incidents to form an index.\nThe measure of risk exposure was based on probability and severity that considers the human perception of equivalent risk. The overall idea behind the CRI was that the performance of the safety system can be analysed in three important broad categories: (1) the quality of the reporting system with reporting entity, (2) measured risks within the system, and (3) the human perception of risk.\nClick here for an explanation of this preliminary CRI methodology including a working example\nAt the same time, the PRC also has highlighted that there could be possibilities to further improve the CRI by considering specific local operating conditions, airspace size, capacity and/or complexity. In order to improve the initial CRI methodology, further consideration of local operating conditions, airspace size and complexity of the airspace were taken into consideration. As a result, three additional components, besides the original one (Safety Data), were considered in the new methodology. The new CRI methodology includes hence four distinct components, or Intermediate Composite Indexes (ICIs):\n\nSafety data (with the following parameters: number and type of safety occurrences, severity classification, and human perception of risk),\nTraffic / exposure data (consisting of the following parameters: flight hours and airport movements),\nComplexity (namely adjusted density, structural index and Complexity index), and\nReporting practices (described through parameters of reporting rate and reporting culture).\n\nFigure @ref(fig:crimethod) shows all components of the proposed CRI index.\n\n\n\n\n\nCRI Methodology Components"
