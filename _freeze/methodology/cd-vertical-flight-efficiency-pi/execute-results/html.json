More detailed case studies are needed\nto find out reasons for particular observations.\n\n\n## Acronyms and terminology\n\nTable: (\\#tab:acronyms) Acronyms and terminology\n\n| Term  | Definition |\n|-------|------------|\n| [CPF][cpf]   | Correlated Position reports for a Flight |\n| [PRISME][prisme] | Pan-European Repository of Information Supporting the Management of EATM |\n\n\n## Methodology\n\nThe main assumption for the analysis of vertical flight efficiency during climb\nand descent is that, all other factors being equal, level flight is considered\nas inefficient.\nThe methodology presented here is very similar for the climb and descent phases\nso the results for the climb and descent phases are directly comparable.\n\n\n\n### General overview\n\nThe analysis is performed in 5 major steps. First, the trajectory data has to\nbe loaded into the analysis software.\nThen the climb or descent part is identified in these trajectories.\nIn these parts of the trajectories the level segments are detected and saved\nand additional filters are applied.\nThe next step is the determination of the Top of Climb or Top of Descent.\nFinally, the results are calculated and processed for presentation.\nThis process is visualised in Figure 1.\n\n\n(ref:vfe-cd-figure-001) Different steps of the analysis.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![(ref:vfe-cd-figure-001)](vfe-cd-figure-001.png){fig-align='center' width=800px}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### Loading of the trajectories information\n\nThe data used for the analysis are downloaded from the PRISME database.\n[CPF][cpf] data is used in order to assess the actually flown trajectories.\n\nThe most important data fields that are of interest for the analysis are\nthe altitude, position (latitude and longitude) and time information.\n\n\n### Identification of the climb or descent part of the flight\n\nFor each flight, the climb part is defined as the part of the trajectory before\nthe Top of Climb (ToC) and the descent part as the part of the trajectory after\nthe Top of Descent (ToD).\n\nOptimal climb and descent parts until/from the cruising altitude generally\nrequire less than 200NM of track distance from/until the airport, especially\nwhen the cost index is low or high for respectively the climb and\ndescent [@airbus-cost-index; @sam-thesis].\nWith this in mind, the analysis is limited to the parts of the trajectories\nwithin a 200NM radius around the departure/arrival airport.\nThis is to avoid including into the analysis climbs during the cruise phase\nwhich are used to optimise the flight altitude to account for the reducing\nweight of the aircraft.\n\nThe identification method of the climb or descent part corresponds strongly\nto the method proposed by the CCO/CDO Task Force and is further detailed below.\nIt should be noted that the CCO/CDO Task Force uses a 300NM radius for the\nclimbs instead of 200NM as used in this analysis.\nThe reasons for choosing a 200NM radius for the climb are threefold:\n\n* Having the same radius for both the climb and descent analysis enables a\n  direct comparison between the climb and descent results; and\n\n* Examination of aircraft trajectories showed that when a radius of 300NM is\n  used, a lot of level flight at slightly lower altitudes than the cruising\n  altitude is detected as inefficient, while this could be a consequence of\n  the optimisation of the cruising altitude with respect to the aircraft’s\n  weight. This type of level flight should not be seen as being inefficient\n  and can influence the final results significantly in such a way that the\n  results are not representative; and\n\n* 300NM was chosen by the CCO/CDO Task Force because some very heavy aircraft\n  could not be able to reach the cruising altitude within a 200NM radius.\n  Nevertheless, it is preferred to have a stable methodology that suits best\n  the behaviour of most of the flights and provides statistically correct\n  results and analyses.\n\n\n\n### Identification of the climb part of a flight\n\nFor each flight, the 4D point where the flight crosses the 200NM radius around\nthe departure airport (for the first time) is determined. This point is defined\nas D200. Within the part of the trajectory from take-off until D200 included,\nthe first 4D point at which the aircraft reaches the highest altitude is\ndefined as the ToC-D200.\nIf the aircraft is still climbing when passing the 200NM radius, D200 and\nToC-D200 are the same.\n\nThe climb phase is considered to start at 3000 feet AGL since the Noise\nAbatement Departure Procedures (NADP) defined by ICAO end at this altitude\n[@icao:8168].\n\nOverall, the part of the trajectory considered for the analysis goes from 3000\nfeet AGL (included) until ToC-D200.\n\nThe CCO/CDO Task Force uses 2500 feet as lower limit which is chosen in\nrelation to the availability of trajectory data.\n\n\n### Identification of the descent part of a flight\n\nFor each flight, the 4D point where the flight crosses the 200NM radius around\nthe destination airport (for the last time) is determined.\nThis point is defined as A200. Within the part of the trajectory from A200\nincluded until touchdown, the last 4D point at which the aircraft leaves\nthe highest altitude is defined as the ToD-A200.\n\nThe descent phase is considered to end at 1800 feet AGL because the\ninterception altitude for ILS systems is generally at or above this altitude.\nUsing 1800 feet AGL as lower limit allows capturing the level segments before\nILS interception but on the other hand disregarding the trajectory below 1800\nfeet AGL where the aircraft are on the ILS glideslope and no level segments\nshould occur.\n\nOverall, the part of the trajectory considered for the analysis goes from\nToD-A200 until 1800 feet AGL (included).\n\n\n\n## Detection of the level segments\n\nIn the climb or descent parts of the trajectories the level segments should be\ndetermined. The trajectory part between two points on that trajectory is\nconsidered as level when the trajectory stays within a fictional window as can\nbe seen in Figure \\@ref(fig:vfe-cd-figure-002).\n\n(ref:vfe-cd-figure-002) Rolling window for level segment detection.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![(ref:vfe-cd-figure-002)](vfe-cd-figure-002.png){fig-align='center' width=500px}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThis window has temporal and altitude dimensions related to a specific vertical\nvelocity that is considered to be the limit between level flight and\nclimb/descent.\nAfter consultation in the CCO/CDO Task Force, this vertical velocity is chosen\nto be 300 feet per minute. Consequently, the dimensions of the window have to\nadhere to the following relationship:\n\n$$\n\\frac{Y}{X} = 300 \\  \\textrm{feet per minute}\n$$\n\nE.g. when a temporal size of 10 seconds is used, the window is 50 feet high.\nIn this case the altitude information of the climb or descent trajectory is\nconsidered at every interval of 10 seconds.\nHowever, since the CPF data are a discrete representation of the actual\ntrajectories, the necessary altitude information is not available for every\nrequired time instance.\nBecause of this and whenever required, a linear interpolation is done to obtain\nthe information needed for the analysis.\n\n\n\n## ToC/ToD determination\n\nIn order to avoid considering level segments that happen slightly below the\ncruising altitude of a flight, an exclusion box is defined.\nThe exclusion box ranges from the altitude of ToC-D200 or ToD-A200 down to 90%\nof this altitude. When a level segment is detected inside the exclusion box and\nit lasts longer than 5 minutes, it is not considered in the final results.\nThe new top of climb or top of descent is in that case put at the start of\n(the first of) such segment(s) for climbs or at the end of (the last of) such\nsegment(s) for descents. This new ToC or ToD is called respectively ToC-CCO or\nToD-CDO. When no level segments longer than 5 minutes are detected inside the\nexclusion box, ToC-CCO/ToD-CDO coincides with ToC-D200/ToD-A200.\n\nThe determination of the ToC-CCO or ToD-CDO corresponds as well to the CCO/CDO\nTask Force’s approach.\n\n\n\n## Processing of the results\n\nThe final results are calculated taking into account all level segments before\nToC-CCO for the climbs and after ToD-CDO for the descents.\n\nThe results of the analysis include the total number of flights, the average\nvalue and median value of the distance flown level, the percentage of distance\nflown level with respect to the total climb or descent distance, the average\nvalue and median value of the time flown level, the percentage of time flown\nlevel with respect to the total climb or descent time and the average value\nand median value of the number of level segments.\n\nAn additional metric is the median CDO/CCO altitude. This metric is calculated\nby taking the altitude of the lowest level segment for each flight.\nThis information is then aggregated by taking the median value over all\nconsidered flights.\nThe rationale for using the lowest level segment is the following.\nIt is best to have no level flight because this increases the fuel burn.\nHowever, if needed, the higher the level segment occurs, the better because\nthe higher the level segment occurs, the lower the fuel burn.\nE.g. a level segment of a fixed duration at FL100 burns more fuel than at\nFL300. So, the lowest level segment is considered since it has the\nhighest environmental impact.\n\nIn addition, each flight can be assessed as being CCO (Continuous Climb\nOperations) or CDO (Continuous Descent Operations). The fact whether a\nflight is considered as being CCO or CDO depends on the allowed amount of\nlevel segments and their allowed lengths or durations.\n\nThe formulas used for the calculation of all these results are shown in Table \\@ref(tab:formulas).\n\nTable: (\\#tab:formulas) Formulas used for the calculation of the results\n\n\n|   Result                                                     |    Formula                      |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------|\n| Total distance flown by flight $f$ during the climb/descent  | (ref:total-flown-cd)            |\n| Percentage of distance flown level during the climb/descent  | (ref:perc-flown-level-cd)       |\n| Average value of the distance flown level per flight         | (ref:avg-flown-flight-level)    |\n| Median value of the level distance                           | (ref:median-level-dist)         |\n| Total time flown by flight $f$ during the climb/descent      | (ref:total-flown-flight-cd)     |\n| Percentage of time flown level during the climb/descent      | (ref:perc-flown-flight-level)   |\n| Average time flown level per flight                          | (ref:avg-time-flight-level)     |\n| Median value of the level time                               | (ref:median-time)               |\n| Average number of level segments per flight                  | (ref:avg-level-segs)            |\n| Median value of the number of level segments                 | (ref:median-level-segs)         |\n| Percentage of flights considered as CCO or CDO               | $$P = \\frac{n_0}{n} \\cdot 100$$ |\n\n\n(ref:total-flown-cd) $$D_f^+ = \\begin{cases} D_{3000, f} -
