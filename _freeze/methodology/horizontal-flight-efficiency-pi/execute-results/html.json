It addresses different audiences with different needs,\nand for that reason the description is provided at increasing level of detail.\n\nSection [Summary of the performance indicator information](#summary-of-the-performance-indicator-information)\nprovides a high level description of the indicator, introduces the \nconcept of achieved distance and provides the rationale for its use as the base\nfor the computation of the additional distance (i.e., the balance of the need to\nevaluate local performance with the need to take into consideration its impact\non the measurement of network performance). It includes a final subsection with\nsome special cases and frequently asked questions which should help clarify how\nit is calculated.\n\n\n\n## Scope\n\nThis document covers the data processing and calculation of the Horizontal\nFlight Efficiency key performance indicators (KEP, KEA, KES).\n\nThe calculation of this performance indicator is performed according to the\nHorizontal Flight Efficiency Data Flow standard for data collection and\nprocessing, under the responsibility of the operations unit in the QoS\ndepartment of the PRU, which is compliant with IR317/2019. The\nHorizontal Flight Efficiency Data Flow associated processes and procedures are\ndocumented as part of the PRU Quality Management System.\n\nThese key performance indicators are also defined in the Implementing Regulation\n(317/2019), Annex I:\n\n* Section 1, Environment 2.1, (KEA, Union-wide level);\n* Section 1, Environment 2.2, (KEP, KES Union-wide level);\n* Section 2, Environment 2.1, (KEA, National, Functional Airspace Block level);\n* Section 2, Environment 2.2, (KEP, KES National, Functional Airspace Block level);\n\n\n\n## Summary of the performance indicator information\n\n* Current version status:  Target Setting.\n\n* Version status and evolution:\n    * Conceptual Phase: phase completed.\n    * Technical Development: phase completed.\n    * Prototyping / Validation: phase completed.\n    * Monitoring: RP1, RP2, RP3, active.\n    * Target Setting: RP1, RP2, RP3, active.\n    * Phase Out: n/a.\n\n* Context\n    * KPA: Environment.\n    * Focus Area: Horizontal Flight Efficiency.\n    * Trade Offs: local and network performance.\n    * Supports the SES Performance Scheme.\n* Description: The indicators provide a measure of the average en route\n  additional distance with respect to the great circle distance.\n* Formula and Metrics\n      \n    The indicator considers all portions of flights traversing an airspace and\n    compares the flown and the achieved distance:\n\n    $$\n    \\textrm{HFE}_j = \\frac{\\sum L_{fjp} - \\sum H_{fjp}}{\\sum H_{fjp}} \\% = \\Big( \\frac{\\sum L_{fjp}}{\\sum H_{fjp}} - 1  \\Big) \\%\n    $$\n    \n    Where $L$ is the length of the trajectory and $H$ is the achieved distance;\n    $f$   is the flight, $j$ is the airspace and $p$ is the portion considered.\n* Units\n    Percentage (additional distance per achieved distance).\n* Used in\n    * SES IR317/2019: Annual Performance Report.\n    * SES eDashboard [ RP1 [@prb:dashboardRP1], RP2 [@prb:dashboardRP2] and RP3 [@prb:dashboardRP3]]\n    * EUROCONTROL: Performance Review Report\n\n\n## Acronyms and terminology\n\nTable: (\\#tab:acronyms) Acronyms and terminology\n\n| Term  | Definition |\n|-------|------------|\n| ANSP  | Air Navigation Service Provider |\n| ATFM  | Air Traffic Flow Management |\n| ATM   | Air Traffic Management |\n| CPF   | Profile based on correlated positions report |\n| CPR   | Correlated Position Report |\n| DB    | Database |\n| EU    | European Union |\n| FAB   | Functional Airspace Block |\n| FAQ   | Frequently Asked Questions |\n| FIR   | Flight Information Region |\n| FTFM  | Last filed flight plan |\n| GCD   | Great Circle Distance |\n| HFE   | Horizontal Flight Efficiency |\n| ICAO  | International Civil Aviation Organization |\n| ID    | Identifier |\n| IR317 | COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 317/2019 |\n| KEA   | Key performance Environment indicator based on Actual trajectory |\n| KEP   | Key performance Environment indicator based on last filed flight Plan |\n| KES   | Key performance Environment indicator based on shortest constrained route available for flight planning |\n| KPA   | Key Performance Area |\n| KPI   | Key Performance Indicator |\n| LOBT  | Last received Off-Block Time |\n| NM    | Network Manager |\n| PRR   | Performance Review Report |\n| PRU   | Performance Review Unit |\n| QoS   | Quality of Service |\n| RP1   | $1^{st}$ Reference Period (2012-2014) |\n| RP2   | $2^{nd}$ Reference Period (2015-2019) |\n| RP3   | $3^{rd}$ Reference Period (2020-2024) |\n| SES   | Single European Sky |\n| TMA   | Terminal Manoeuvring Area |\n\n\n\n# Conceptual model The Horizontal Flight Efficiency\n\nHorizontal flight efficiency (HFE) is very simply defined at its highest level:\nthe comparison between the length of a trajectory and the shortest distance\nbetween its endpoints.\n\n\n(ref:hfe-01) HFE as comparison of flight length and Great Circle Distance.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"hfe-01.png\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![(ref:hfe-01)](hfe-01.png){width=400px}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nFor an entire flight we want to calculate the additional distance flown between\ntake-off and landing with respect to the most direct route between the two\nairports (Great Circle Distance). The need of a more detailed definition arises\nbecause we need to take into consideration different variations from the\nsituation described above, such as the possibility that one (if not both) of the\nairports does not belong to the area on which we would like to measure the\nefficiency and the need to define the measurement on a portion of the flight\n(e.g., en route) instead than for the whole trajectory.\n\nIn addition, there is a specific need which stems from the SES requirements \n**to measure local performance (FAB level) while at the\nsame time keeping the network perspective.**\n\n\n(ref:hfe-02) Local Performance Requirement.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"hfe-02.png\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![(ref:hfe-02)](hfe-02.png){width=700px}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe desired outcome is illustrated in the table above. We are interested in all\nflights which traverse at least in part the Single European Sky (SES) area. A\nflight might traverse several FABs but also areas which are not part of the SES\narea. This means that, for the purpose of measuring flight efficiency in the SES\narea, we are interested only in the values in the green cells of the table. At\nthe same time we would like to be able to consider the additional distances\nalong the flight dimension (i.e., along a row, giving a flight value in the\nlight blue cell in the last column) and along the FAB dimension (i.e., along a\ncolumn, giving a FAB value in the light blue cell in the last row) and obtain\nconsistent values. The sum of the all values in the green cells, the sum of all\nvalues in the last column (i.e. sum of flight values) and the sum of all values\nin the last row (i.e., sum of the FAB values) should all be the same (i.e.,\nusing flight values and using FAB values should lead to the same sum when\nconsidering all flights in the SES area).\n\nThis is true when the values in the table correspond to the flown distance and\nthe achieved distance (defined in the following section), which allows to\napportion the great circle distance for the entire trajectory to any of its\nparts, e.g., between the entry and exit into a FAB.\n\n\n## The achieved distance\n\nThe achieved distance is the average of two quantities. The first quantity\nconsiders how closer to destination the trajectory takes from its entry point\ninto an area to its exit point from the area (left part of\nFigure \\@ref(fig:hfe-03)). This can be calculated as the\ndifference between\n\n1. the great circle distance from the entry point N to the destination D and\n1. the great circle distance from the exit point X to the destination D.\n\n\n(ref:hfe-03) The two Quantities Averaged in the Achieved Distance.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"hfe-03.png\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![(ref:hfe-03)](hfe-03.png){width=550px}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nIn the Figure \\@ref(fig:hfe-03), the distance from $N$ to\n$D$ is the radius of the circle centred at $D$ and going through the point of\nentry $N$, while the distance from $X$ to $D$ is the radius of the circle\ncentred at $D$ and going through the point $X$.\n\nIn a similar way the second quantity considers how further from origin the\ntrajectory takes from its entry point into an area to its exit point from the\narea (right part of the picture). The roles of the entry point $N$ and the exit\npoint $X$ are reversed and the quantity is calculated as the difference between \n\n1. the great circle distance from the origin $O$ and the exit point $X$, and\n1. the great circle distance from the origin $O$ and the entry point $N$.\n\nConsidering two specific points along the trajectory (for example its entry\npoint $N$ and its exit point $X$ into/from an area), together with the origin\n$O$ and the destination $D$, the formula to compute the achieved distance is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} ( \\text{ND} - \\text{XD} + \\text{OX} - \\text{ON} )\n$$\n\nwhere all the distances between points are calculated as great circle distances.\n\nIt can be verified that taking a sequence of points between $O$ and $D$, e.g., a\nsequence of entry/exit points in different areas, the sum of the achieved\ndistances (including the one from the origin to the first point and the one from\nthe last point to the destination) is equal to the great circle distance between\nthe origin and the destination.\n\n\n## Achieved distances and network contribution\n\nIt might seem natural to consider the comparison of the flown distance in a\nlocal area with the great circle distance between the entry and exit point of\nthe same area. Such a measurement would not take into consideration the network\nperspective, as can be seen in the (extreme, for illustration purposes) example\nof the Figure \\@ref(fig:hfe-04).\n\n(ref:hfe-04) A case of perfect local efficiency with no network contribution.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"hfe-04.png\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![(ref:hfe-04)](hfe-04.png){width=480px}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe red trajectory between the entry point N and the exit point X is perfectly\nstraight and would be considered perfectly efficient from the local point of\nview, while from the network perspective there has been no improvement as the\naircraft would be no closer to destination (and no further from the origin).\n\n\nThe great circle distance taken as reference is the one between the origin and\ndestination of the flight. The sum of the great circle distances in the\ndifferent areas traversed is always larger than the great circle distance\nbetween origin and destination. Given that the sum of the flown distance would\nbe the same, using local great circle distances for the comparison would always\nunderestimate the inefficiency at flight level. The achieved distances, on the\nother hand, do sum up to the great circle distance between origin and\ndestination.\n\n\n\n## Decomposition of inefficiency in local and interface components\n\nThe value of the achieved distance between two points is by construction less\nthan the direct distance between the same two points. This enables a\ndecomposition of the inefficiency into a local component (which we call\nextension) and a network contribution (which we call interface) as shown in\nthe Figure \\@ref(fig:hfe-05).\n\n(ref:hfe-05) Decomposition of Inefficiency.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"hfe-05.png\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![(ref:hfe-05)](hfe-05.png){width=600px}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nIn the example of the previous section, the extension is zero (the red line\ncorresponds to the direct between entry and exit) and the inefficiency is equal\nto the interface value. The exact interface value would depend on the position\nof the entry and exit points with respect to the origin and destination of the\ntrajectory. If both $N$ and $X$ were equidistant from the origin and destination\n(i.e., $\\overline{OX} = \\overline{XD}$ and $\\overline{ON} = \\overline{ND}$) the\nachieved distance would be zero and the interface value would be equal to the\ndirect distance between entry and exit. From the network point of view, since\nthere is “no improvement” in the goal of getting from origin to destination, any\ndistance flown between the two points should be considered as additional\ndistance.\n\n\n## Independence of local performance from performance outside the local area\n\n(ref:hfe-06) Independence of local performance from performance outside the local area.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"hfe-06.png\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![(ref:hfe-06)](hfe-06.png){width=700px}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe value of the achieved distance to be considered for a local area depends\nonly on the position of the entry and exit points with respect to the origin and\ndestination of the trajectory. As a consequence, the value of the local\ninefficiency is independent from the characteristics of the rest of the\ntrajectory.\n\nConsider the situation in Figure \\@ref(fig:hfe-06) (once again an\nextreme example to illustrate the point), with two flights traversing a FAB, one\nwith a direct trajectory from the origin to destination (thus both inside and\noutside the FAB), and the other with a direct (and aligned) trajectory inside\nthe FAB but with an inefficient trajectory outside the FAB.\n\nWith the achieved distance, the value used for the FAB measurement will be the\nsame for both flights because inside the FAB the trajectory is identical (in\nthis specific case both the extension and the interface will be zero, as the\ntrajectory is direct between entry and exit and the entry and exit points are\naligned with the origin and destination).\n\nIt has been proposed to compute the value of the local efficiency as the\naverage, taken over all flights traversing the local area, of the entire\ntrajectories. In the example above, while the two trajectories are identical\nwithin the FAB, their contribution would be different because the inefficiency\nof trajectory $1$ outside the FAB will be taken into account (as a matter of\nfact, the calculation would not isolate the local performance). As a result, the\ninefficiency of the FAB will also be greater than zero.\n\n\n\n\n## Summary of the different quantities\n\nTable \\@ref(tab:quantities) below provides a summary of the different quantities\ninvolved in the computation of the additional distance (and therefore the\ninefficiency) for a flight. As can be seen in the last column, while the lengths\nof the trajectory, the achieved distances and the additional distances are\nadditive, the same is not true for the lengths of direct\ncourse, the extensions and the interfaces. In particular, it\nshould be noted that it is the sum of the achieved distances which corresponds\nto the great circle distance for the flight, not the sum of the length of direct\ncourses. \n\nTable: (\\#tab:quantities) Summary of the different quantities used to compute HFE\n\n| Name | Network | Local (area $J$) | Consistency local and network | Additive |\n|------|---------|------------------|-------------------------------|----------|\n| Length of trajectory | $L$ | $L_j$ | $\\sum_{j} L_j = L$ |  Yes  |\n| Length of direct course | $G$ | $G_j$ | $\\sum_{j} G_j \\ne G$ |  No  |\n| Achieved distance | $H (= G)$ | $H_j$ | $\\sum_{j} H_j = G (= H)$ |  Yes  |\n| Extension | $E = L -G$ | $E_j$ | $\\sum_{j} E_j \\ne L - G (= E)$ |  No  |\n| Interface | $I = G - H$ | $I_j$ | $\\sum_{j} I_j \\ne 0 (= I)$ |  No  |\n| Additional distance | $K = L -H (= L - G)$ | $K_j = L_j - H_j$ | $\\sum_{j} K_j = K$ |  Yes  |\n\n\n\n## Aggregation of results to produce the indicator\n\nOnce the origin and destination of a flight have been set, via the use of\nachieved distances it is possible to compute in a consistent way the value of\nthe indicator between any two points of the trajectory of a flight. It is\nimportant to note that the flight efficiency is an average measurement where\n**the average is taken over distances and not over flights**. This is\nparticularly useful when dealing with three specific aspects:\n\n* The measurement of the en-route flight inefficiency. The indicator is\n  concerned with the enroute flight inefficiency defined as the measurement\n  which excludes 40 nautical miles around airports. The measurement does not\n  start until the trajectory has crossed (for the first time) the cylinder with\n  a 40 nautical miles radius around the airport of departure and ends when the\n  trajectory crosses (for the last time) the cylinder with a 40 nautical miles\n  radius around the airport of arrival.\n* The measurement of local inefficiencies. The indicator based on achieved\n  distances is well defined even when the direct route between origin and\n  destination does not cross the local area. It is also well defined when a\n  trajectory exits and re-enters a local area (the two measurements are\n  independent).\n* The measurement of inefficiency when the trajectory is not complete (which\n  might be the case for CPF trajectories). The measurement is well defined for\n  every portion of the trajectory, and does not require a complete trajectory.\n\nWhen looking at a specific flight, it is always possible to decompose the flight\nin different portions, of which some will not be taken into consideration for\nthe calculation of the indicator (as an example, the first part of the\ntrajectory will never be included because it will either be inside the 40\nnautical miles or outside of the reference area). Every portion can be\nattributed to a specific measured area (e.g., a State, a FAB, the SES area).\n\nFlight efficiency compares the length of a trajectory with the great circle\ndistance. The indicator is expressed as a ratio of the length of trajectories\nand achieved distances:\n\n$$\n\\text{HFE}_j = \\frac{\\sum L_{fjp} - \\sum H_{fjp}}{\\sum H{fjp}} \\% = \\left( \\frac{\\sum L_{fjp}}{\\sum H_{fjp}} - 1 \\right) \\%\n$$\n\nIn words, the en route horizontal flight efficiency indicator for an area j is\ntaken by summing the values over all flights f and all en route portions p in\nthe area (a flight might re-enter the area).\n\nAt a technical level, it is worth noting again that the indicator is an average\nper distance unit and not per flight.\n\n\n\n## Difference between KEP, KEA, KES\n\nThere is no difference in the methodology used to calculate the value of the two\nindicators. The KEP indicator is the horizontal flight efficiency calculated\nusing the last filed flight plans to describe the trajectories, while KEA uses\nthe trajectories generated via radar data. KES is based on the shortest constrained \nroute available for flight planning.\n\nIn order to smooth out the influence of unusual events, in reporting annual\nvalues the ten best days and the ten worst days (for each measured area) will be\nexcluded from the computation.\n\n\n\n## Specific/special cases and FAQ\n\nThe origin and destination points are defined via the reference area chosen,\nwhile the definition of the end route portion of the flight depends on the 40\nnautical miles cylinder (cylinder and circle are used interchangeably) around\nthe airports. In the general case in which the airports and the corresponding\ncircles are fully inside or outside the reference area the following table\n\\@ref(tab:locations) is\nvalid (the definition of the type of flight is based on the location of the\nairports with respect to the reference area):\n\n\nTable: (\\#tab:locations) General location of origin, destination and en-route end-points\n\n| Type of flight | Origin  | En-route Starts | En-route Ends | Destination |\n|----------------|---------|-----------------|---------------|-------------|\n| Internal       | Airport |  40 NM          | 40 NM         | Airport     |\n| Arriving       | Border  |  Border         | 40 NM         | Airport     |\n| Departing      | Airport |  40 NM          | Border        | Border      |\n| Overflying     | Border  |  Border         | Border                      |\n\n\n\n\n\n1. **What is the difference between reference area and measured area?**\n    \n    The reference area is the one used to identify the origin and the destination\n    of a flight. A measured area is an area for which HFE values are reported.\n    Any measured area (e.g., State, FAB, SES area) must be contained in the\n    reference area.\n\n1. **What is the definition of origin and destination?**\n\n    The origin and destination correspond to the first and last point of the\n    trajectory within the reference area, where the trajectory considered is the\n    entire trajectory from airport to airport. Any portion of the trajectory\n    before the origin and after the destination is ignored when calculating the\n    flight efficiency. There is one origin and one destination for each\n    trajectory. Origin and destination are defined at trajectory level – O and D\n    in the notation used in previous section are the same for all entries and\n    exits of a trajectory.\n\n1. **What happens when the trajectory crosses the 40 nautical miles cylinder\n   several times?**\n   \n    Only one point is taken into consideration for each airport. For the\n    departure airport it corresponds to the first crossing, while for the arrival\n    airport it corresponds to the last crossing. The en route part of the flight\n    is the one between those two points. Any portion before or after the en route\n    part is ignored when calculating the en route flight efficiency. The start\n    and the end en route phase are defined at trajectory level.\n\n1.  **What happens when the circle around the airport is not fully inside/outside\n    the reference area?**<br>\n    **What happens when the en route portion begins/ends inside a measured area?**<br>\n    **What happens when part of the trajectory is not available?**\n    \n    All the above questions relate to the definition of the portions of\n    trajectory used for the calculation of the en route indicator for a measured\n    area. Four separate and independent aspects have to be considered:\n    * A portion has to be within the origin and the destination (for flight\n      efficiency to be defined);\n    * A portion has to be en route (i.e., the cylinders around airports have to\n      excluded);\n    * A portion has to be within the measured area;\n    * The information has to be available.\n\n    The four conditions have to be valid at the same time. This means that in some\n    cases the end points of the portion considered for flight efficiency in a\n    measured area (the entry N and the exit X in the notation used in previous\n    sections) will not correspond to the borders of the measured area.\n\n    The main reason for the entry/exit points not being on the border of the\n    measured area is the exclusion of the circles around the airport (see table\n    above and the following examples). A secondary reason is the absence of\n    information for a part of a trajectory (see example below).\n\n    Consider the case of a flight departing from a measured area A, with the\n    circle/cylinder entirely contained in the measurement area A. The origin ($O_f$)\n    will be the airport because it will be the first point into the reference area\n    (a measured area is always part of the reference area). As the part within the\n    cylinder has to be excluded when measuring the en route flight efficiency, the\n    entry into the measured area ($N_A$) will correspond to the first crossing of\n    the (departure airport) cylinder. It is neither the airport (airports can never\n    be the entry or exit point for en route flight efficiency because of the\n    exclusion of the circle around them) nor the border of the measured area A. The\n    situation corresponds to the standard “departing” or “internal” row in the table\n    above.\n\n    Consider the same case above, except that the circle extends into another\n    measured area B and the first crossing is happening there. The origin will still\n    be located at the airport in measured area A, but there will be no portion of\n    trajectory considered for measured area A because the en route part will not\n    have started. The entry into measured area B (NB) will again correspond to the\n    first crossing of the (departure airport) cylinder and not the airport or the\n    border of measured area B.\n\n    As a third alternative, consider the case where the circle around area A extends\n    outside the reference area, the first crossing happens there and the flight then\n    re-enter measured area A. The origin will again be located at the airport; the\n    en route portion will start outside the reference area; the first entry into\n    area A (NA) will be the one from outside the reference area.\n\n    Last, consider the case where a flight traverses a measured area, with entry and\n    exit on the borders but with a part of the trajectory for which the information\n    is missing. In that case there will be two portions of the trajectory\n    considered: the first one from the border ($N_1$) until the information is lost\n    ($X_1$) and a second one from when the information is again available ($N_2$)\n    until the exit from the measured area ($X_2$).\n1. **What happens when the trajectory enters an area several times?**\n    Every couple of entry and exit points (see the previous answer for why the\n    entry and exit points might not correspond to points on the border of the\n    measured area considered) defines a portion of the flight for which the length\n    of the trajectory and the achieved distance can be calculated. All portions\n    within a measured area are considered in the calculation of the indicator for\n    that area.\n    \n    It is important to note that multiple entries are considered separately and it\n    is not the first point of entry and the last point of exit of a measured area\n    which are considered (see last example in the previous question).\n1. **Can the achieved distance be negative?**\n    The achieved distance relies on the order of the points considered; it is\n    therefore possible (although uncommon) for the local achieved distance to be\n    negative. This ensures that the calculation of the local additional distances\n    is consistent (any partition of the trajectory gives the same result).\n1. **What is the impact of short flights (for which the great circle distance is small)?**\n   The horizontal flight efficiency (HFE) is not an average per flight, but a\n   weighted average which takes into consideration the great circle distance\n   ($K$ is the additional distance, $G$ is the great circle distance, $H$ is the\n   achieved distance; $f$ indicates a flight, $j$ indicates an area, $p$\n   indicates a portion of the flight):\n\n    $$\n    \\text{HFE} = \\sum w_f \\cdot \\frac{K_f}{G_f} = \\sum \\frac{G_f}{\\sum G_f} \\cdot \\frac{K_f}{G_f}\n    = \\frac{\\sum K_f}{\\sum G_f} = \\frac{K_f}{H_f} \\cong \\frac{\\sum K_{fjp}}{\\sum\n    H_{fjp}}\n    $$\n\n    The contribution to the additional distance of each portion of the flight is\n    proportional to the achieved distance of the same portion. The impact of\n    short flights is therefore proportional to their lengths.\n1. **What is the impact of unusual circumstances on the annual indicator?**\n   \n   When calculating the annual indicator the values for the ten best days and\n   the ten worst days are excluded from the computation.\n\n\n# References\n\n",
