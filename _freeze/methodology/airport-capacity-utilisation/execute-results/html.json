The latter may also be impacted by local\nconstraints or requirements of the capacity declaration process.\n\n\n(ref:ccc) Capacity Coverage Chart.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![(ref:ccc)](ccc.png){fig-align='center' width=400px}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe capacity coverage chart (i.e. CCC) describes the ordered set of observed\nthroughputs at an airport. As depicted in Figure \\@ref(fig:ccc), the CCC varies\ndependent on the traffic, enviromental factors, and/or operational\nconstraints. Ordering the observed (hourly) throughputs for the airport\nestablishes a generally decreasing step function over the time horizon (e.g.\nexpressed in terms of observation hours or % of time).\n\n\n[@apt-capacity-utilisation] describe a procedure to quantify\nthe level of capacity utilisation comparing two characteristic throughput values.\nThese characteristic values, i.e. basic load index (BLI) and peak load index (PLI),\nare based on the observed operational throughput of the airport.\n\n\n(ref:pli-bli) Capacity Coverage Chart and PLI calculation.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![(ref:pli-bli)](pli_bli.png){fig-align='center' width=400px}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe Base Load Index (BLI) refers to the share of time an airport operates above a defined base\nlevel (15% of the reference capacity) and the Peak Load index (PLI) provides an indication\nof the share of time the airport operates above peak level (80% of reference capacity).\n\nConsidering the achieved levels of throughput across the European top 30 airports,\na diverse picture emerges.\nWhile a number of airports show the classical throughput peaking behaviour with a consistent\nbase level throughout ($0.65 < \\textrm{BLI} < 0.8$), London Heathrow (LHR) in the top right corner\nshows a clear exceptional capacity utilisation.\n\n\n(ref:pli-bli-prr) BLI over PLI for major European airports.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![(ref:pli-bli-prr)](pli_bli_prr.png){fig-align='center' width=400px}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nFor a more detailed explanation of the methodology see [@apt-capacity-utilisation].\n\n## See Also\n\n* [Basic Load Index (BLI)][bli].\n* [Peak Load Index (PLI)][pli].\n\n[bli]: /acronym/bli/ \"Basic Load Index\"\n[pli]: /acronym/pli/ \"Peak Load Index\"\n\n\n# References\n\n\n\n",
