All details about the review work can be found [here](/publications/studies/2022_11_17_prc_apt_cons/).\n\nThe new methodology is applied starting with the analysis of January 2023 performance and retroactively to 2015.\n\nResults with the old methodology up to December 2022 are available for consultation in our [download page](/data/) and were used in performance reports up to and including PRR 2022.",
