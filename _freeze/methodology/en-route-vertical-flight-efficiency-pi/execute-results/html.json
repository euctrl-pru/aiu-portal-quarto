The objective of\nthe methodology is to measure and observe vertical flight efficiency without highlighting specific\nreasons for the observed behaviour. More detailed case studies are needed to find out reasons for\nparticular observations.\n\n\n## Acronyms and terminology\n\n\n| Term             | Definition                                                               |\n|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| [FTFM][ftfm]     | Trajectory information based on the last filed flight plan               |\n| [GCD][gcd]       | Great Circle Distance                                                    |\n| [PRISME][prisme] | Pan-European Repository of Information Supporting the Management of EATM |\n| [RAD][rad]       | Route Availability Document                                              |\n| VFI              | Vertical Flight Inefficiency                                             |\n: Acronyms and terminology {#tbl-acronyms}\n\n\n## Methodology\n\n### Approach and assumptions\n\nThe general approach of the analysis is to compare the maximum altitudes in the flight plans of\nflights between a specific airport pair with the maximum altitudes of flights between similar\nairport pairs, hereafter called reference flights. Reference flights are flights between\nunconstrained (in terms of RAD restrictions) airport pairs which have a great circle distance close\nto the one of the examined airport pair.\n\nSince the aircraft type has a significant influence on the nominal cruising altitude, the analysis\nis done using specific aircraft types with similar performance (e.g. only jet aircraft, turboprop\naircraft ...) Currently only Airbus and Boeing aircraft are considered since they account for the\nbiggest portion of scheduled commercial flights.\n\nThe use of the maximum altitude in the flight plan leads to an underestimation of the vertical\nflight inefficiency because there can be lower cruise segments before or after the moment the\nmaximum altitude is reached. These cruise segments can be even more inefficient since the fuel\nconsumption at lower altitudes is in general higher.\n\nTo account for statistical uncertainty, the lowest and highest 10 percent of the flights (when\nsorted according to their maximum altitudes) are excluded.\n\n\n### General overview\n\nThe analysis is done in 4 major steps. First, the necessary data are extracted from the data source.\nThen the reference distributions are calculated such that they can be used for all the airport pairs\nunder investigation. For each considered airport pair, the maximum altitudes in the flight plan are\nprocessed in order to be compared with the reference. In the last step the different metrics are\ncalculated. The process is visualised in @fig-vfe-er-figure-001.\n\n![Different steps of the analysis.](vfe-er-figure-001.png){#fig-vfe-er-figure-001}\n\n\nThe following paragraphs explain these steps in further detail.\n\n\n### Loading of the trajectories information\n\nThe data used for the analysis are downloaded from the PRISME database. FTFM data is used in order\nto assess the maximum altitudes in the flight plans. The most important data fields for the analysis\nare the altitude and time information.\n\n\n### Definition of the reference distribution\n\nReference airport pairs are airport pairs with a great circle distance (GCD) close to the great\ncircle distance of the considered airport pair and which have no constraints in the RAD.\n\nReference distributions are calculated for buckets of GCD ranges, e.g. a reference is calculated for\nall airport pairs in the GCD ranges [0,10) NM, [10,20) NM, etc. This approach reduces the\ncalculation time significantly since only one calculation is needed and the reference for a specific\nairport pair will be the one of the corresponding bucket.\n\nThe reference distribution is created using a large number of flights with no specific filtering\nexcept for the aircraft type. This is done in order to get a reference distribution irrespective of\nfactors such as aircraft weights, weather phenomena, company policies...\n\nThe reference is based on the assumption that flights between airport pairs with similar GCDs,\nperformed with a similar aircraft type, would file for similar maximum altitudes. The\ndifferentiating factor between the two sets of flights can be the presence of RAD constraints,\nscenarios, airline policy, mistakes in the flight planning system, etc., and if the distribution of\nthe maximum altitudes of flights on the chosen airport pair doesn’t follow the reference\ndistribution, this could be an indication of inefficiency.\n\n\n\n### Distribution of the maximum altitudes\n\nAs is done for the reference, the distribution of the maximum altitudes flown on the considered\nairport pair is determined. Having the distributions of the reference and the considered flow on the\nairport pair allows for plotting a diagram as in the Figure \\@ref(fig:vfe-er-figure-002).\n\nFigure \\@ref(fig:vfe-er-figure-002) shows the histograms of the maximum filed altitudes both for the reference flights and the\nflights on the chosen airport pair. The numbers on the right of the bars indicate the number of\nflights while the length of the bar indicates the percentage of flights. E.g. the large blue bar at\nFL350 represents 260 flights, being 76.2% of the total number of flights on the chosen airport pair.\nThe sum of the percentages corresponding to the lengths of the bars is 100% both for the blue and\nfor the red bars. As can be seen from the values of the number of flights, there are a lot more\nflights in the reference distribution which makes it a stable reference.\n\n\n(ref:vfe-er-figure-002) Example distribution of maximum altitudes.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"vfe-er-figure-002.png\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![(ref:vfe-er-figure-002)](vfe-er-figure-002.png){width=900px}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe data in Figure \\@ref(fig:vfe-er-figure-002) above can be represented differently,\nusing percentiles as shown in Figure \\@ref(fig:vfe-er-figure-003).\nTo obtain this, the percentages from Figure \\@ref(fig:vfe-er-figure-002) are simply put successively. E.g. the percentages of\nthe chosen airport pair (blue bars: 2.6% at FL310, 21.1% at FL330 and 76.2% at FL350) are plotted at\ntheir respective altitudes to get the blue line in Figure \\@ref(fig:vfe-er-figure-003).\nThe same is done for the reference.\n\nThe example represents an airport pair on which, in general, flights are filing higher than the\nreference. There are however some percentiles where reference flights are filing higher than the\nflights on the considered airport pair. Only this part is used in the calculation of vertical flight\ninefficiency (VFI) in order to flag only the inefficiencies.\nThe red shaded area in Figure \\@ref(fig:vfe-er-figure-003)\nindicates the VFI. The dark grey areas on the left and right highlight the percentiles that are\nexcluded to account for statistical uncertainty as mentioned before.\n\n(ref:vfe-er-figure-003) Example distribution of maximum altitudes.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"vfe-er-figure-003.png\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![(ref:vfe-er-figure-003)](vfe-er-figure-003.png){width=900px}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### Calculation of the metrics\n\nThe VFI is calculated using the percentiles as shown in Figure \\@ref(fig:vfe-er-figure-003).\nFor each percentile range, the\naltitude value of the airport pair is subtracted from the reference value. When the airport pair\nvalue is higher than the reference value, the result of the subtraction is negative. This might\nappear as if the flights are more efficient than the reference flights. Nevertheless, the focus is\nput on finding the inefficiencies so negative values are set to 0.\n\nThe result of the percentile range is then multiplied by the number of flights corresponding to the\npercentile range (e.g. if the width of the percentile range is 1%, the number of flights\ncorresponding to the percentile range is 1% of the total number of flights on the airport pair).\n\nSumming up over all percentile ranges gives the total vertical flight inefficiency. The vertical\nflight inefficiency per flight value is then calculated by dividing the total vertical flight\ninefficiency by the number of flights on the considered airport pair (the number of flights for this\ncalculation step is 80% of the total number of flights on the airport pair since the lowest 10% and\nhighest 10% of the flights are not used).\n\nTable \\@ref(tab:formulas) summarises the formulas used for the calculation of the VFI metrics.\n\n\nTable: (\\#tab:formulas) Formulas used for the calculation of the results\n\n| Result                                                   |  Formula         |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------|\n| Total vertical flight inefficiency (Total VFI)           | (ref:total-vfi)  |\n| Vertical flight inefficiency per flight (VFI per flight) | (ref:vfi-flight) |\n\n(ref:total-vfi) $$VFI_{\\mathrm{tot}} = \\sum_{i} \\max(L_{\\mathrm{ref}, i} - L_{\\mathrm{act}, i}, 0) \\cdot n_{\\mathrm{act}, i}$$\n\n(ref:vfi-flight) $$\\frac{VFI_{\\mathrm{tot}} }{\\sum_{i} n_{\\textrm{act}, i}}$$\n\n\nWith:\n\n| Symbol| Description |\n|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| $i$             | Percentile range                                                      |\n| $L_{ {ref}, i}$ | Flight level of the $i^{th}$ percentile range over all reference flights in the GCD bucket around the GCD of the considered airport pair. |\n| $L_{ {act}, i}$ | Flight level of the $i^{th}$ percentile range over all flights on the considered airport pair. |\n| $n_{ {act}, i}$ | Number of flights on the considered airport pair in the percentile range. |\n\n\n[rad]: /acronym/rad/ \"RAD\"\n[prisme]: /acronym/prisme/ \"PRISME\"\n[gcd]: /acronym/gcd/ \"GCD\"\n[ftfm]: /acronym/ftfm/ \"FTFM\"\n\n\n## Further Information\n\nFor further information please refer also to\n[@icns-vfe; @en-route-vertical-flight-efficiency_consultation].\n\n\n## References\n",
