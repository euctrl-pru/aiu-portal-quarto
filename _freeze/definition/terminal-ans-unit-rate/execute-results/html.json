Calculation of terminal unit rates\n\n#### 2.1. The terminal unit rate shall be calculated before the beginning of each year of the reference period.\n\n#### 2.2. It shall be calculated by dividing the forecast number of total Terminal ANS Service Unit for the relevant year into the algebraic sum of the following elements:\n\n* the determined costs of the relevant year,\n* the application of the difference between forecasted and actual inflation as referred to in Article 6(1),\n* the carry-overs resulting from the implementation of the traffic risk-sharing referred to in Article 11a(2) to (7) ,\n* the carry-overs from the previous reference period resulting from the implementation of the cost risk-sharing referred to in Article 11a(8),\n* bonuses and penalties resulting from the financial incentives referred to in Article 12(2),\n* for the first two reference periods, the over or under recoveries incurred by Member States up to the year preceding the application of this Regulation to terminal charges,\n* a deduction of the costs of VFR flights as identified in Article 7(4).\n\n--------------------\n\n\n## References\n\n",
