The analysis of these massive groundings of aircraft across Europe in the dashboard below provided another perspective on the magnitude of the impact on the airline sector, with more than 6000 aircraft inactive in Europe in April and May 2020.\n\nThe timeline shows how the majority of the groundings took place in the second half of March 2020, while a clear recovery was observed since the beginning of June 2020, with progressively more aircraft returning to fly in the EUROCONTROL area.\n\nThe interactive dashboard below enables an analysis of the number of active and inactive aircraft by state, airport they sleep at, or aircraft operator.\n</div></div>\n \n<small>Please note that the analysis may take a few moments to load.
