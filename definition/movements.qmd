### 1.2 MOVEMENTS, FLOWS, FLIGHTS, TRAFFIC

#### 1.2.1 Movement
The association of a flight stage with an airspace volume or two-dimensional area. Each such association is bounded in time by 2 flight stage events: begin/entry and end/exit. In relation to an airspace volume, movement can be interrupted. In relation to two-dimensional area, movement cannot be interrupted.
Movements are divided to Internals, Arrivals, Departures and Overflights.

#### 1.2.2 Arrival
Arrival is a movement, which starts with the entry into the airspace volume or two-dimensional area. It ends with arrival at an aerodrome belonging to the airspace volume or two-dimensional area considered.

#### 1.2.3 Departure
Departure is a movement, which starts on aerodrome belonging to the airspace volume or two-dimensional area considered. It ends with exit from the airspace volume or two-dimensional area considered.

#### 1.2.4 Internal
Internal is a movement, which starts with departure aerodrome and ends with arrival aerodrome both belonging to the airspace volume or two-dimensional area considered.

#### 1.2.5 Overflight
Overflight is a movement, which starts with entry and ends with exit of the airspace volume considered.

#### Examples of movements:
Let's assume Franceâ€™s airspace is the airspace volume considered. Every movement, which passes over France, falls into one and only one of the four categories: departures, arrivals, overflights, and internals. 

*  If the movement started and ended in France then it is called **internal**. 
*  If a movement started in France but it ended abroad then it is a **departure**. 
*  If a flight stage started in a foreign country and the movement entered to the French airspace volume and ended in a French airport then it is called an **arrival**. 
*  Finally a movement which passes over France but never lands there is called an **overflight**.

As the airspace volume considered changes, the same flight stage would be counted differently in terms of movements. Let's think about a flight stage from Germany to France. 

* From the perspective of the NM Area this flight stage will be counted as an **internal** movement. 
* From the perspective of German airspace volume, this flight stage will be counted as **departure** movement, and 
* from the perspective of French airspace volume it will be counted as an **arrival** movement.

A flight stage can be an internal movement for airspace volume but also an overflight for another airspace volume. Guernsey to London is an internal UK movement which overflies France.

An airspace volume with no airports (e.g. Maastricht UAC airspace) can have only overflights.

An airport cannot have overflights.
