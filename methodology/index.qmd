In order to encourage collaboration, transparency and reproducibility of performance indicators, please find below methodological information related to the computation of the indicators used in our website:

#### Safety
* [Composite Risk Index][cri-pi]

#### Capacity
  * [ATFM delay computation][atfmdelay]
  * [Airport Capacity Utilisation][acu]

#### Efficiency/ Environment
  * [Additional Taxi Out Time][ATXOT]
  * [Horizontal Flight Efficiency performance indicators][hfe]
  * [En-route Vertical Flight Efficiency][ervfe]
  * [Vertical Flight Efficiency during Climb and Descent][cdvfe]
  * [Additional ASMA Time][ASMA]
  * [Additional Taxi In Time][ATXIT]

#### Economics
  * [ATM Cost-Efficiency (ACE) Handbook][ace]
