title: RAD - Route Availability Document

The Route Availability Document is a flight-planning document, which integrates
both structural and [ATFCM](atfcm.md) requirements, geographically and vertically,
following an appropriate [collaborative decision making](cdm.md) process between
the [network manager](nm-cfmu.md) and the operational stakeholders.
It is a 'central' source of airspace utilisation rules and availability
defined and communicated by the [ANSP](ansp.md)s, 56 days before the start of the
concerned Aeronautical Information Regulation and Control ([AIRAC](airac.md)) cycle.

It facilitates flight planning in order to improve
Air traffic Flow and Capacity Management ([ATFCM](atfcm.md)) while allowing
aircraft operators' flight planning flexibility.

It also enables [ANSP](ansp.md)s to maximise capacity and reduce complexity by defining
restrictions that prevent disruption to the organised system of major traffic
flows through the congested areas with due regard to aircraft operators
requirements.
