slug: etfms
---

The Enhanced Tactical Flow Management System is used to compare traffic demand
with the available capacity of a certain air traffic control ([ATC](atc.md))
sector.
It is a key enabler of the air traffic flow and capacity management
([ATFCM](atfcm.md)) services during tactical operations (on the day of the flight)
and pre-tactical operations (from 1 to 6 days before the flight is airborne).

The ETFMS system has two main functions:

* Calculation of traffic demand in every sector of the [NM](nm-cfmu.md) area of
  operations, using the flight plan information received from the
  aircraft operators (AOs) via the initial flight plan processing
  system ([IFPS](ifps.md))

* Calculation, via Computer-assisted slot allocation ([CASA](casa.md)), and distribution
  of the departure slots.
