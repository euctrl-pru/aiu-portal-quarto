Planned Flight Data (PFD) is one of the quality types indicator for data stored
in ALL_FT+ files archived/exported by NM system/services, i.e. [DDR2](ddr2.qmd).

All flights published in the [OAG](oag.qmd) are known as Planned Flight Data
within the [NM](nm-cfmu.qmd) context and only contain the served city pair,
i.e. no route information is provided.
