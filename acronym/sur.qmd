Shortest Unconstrained Route is the shortest route between two points planned
using the existing route network.
SUR does not take into account limitations by [CDR](cdr.qmd) or 
Route Availability Document ([RAD](rad.qmd)).

The associated distance measures how effectively the route network is designed.
